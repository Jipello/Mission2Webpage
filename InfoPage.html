            </p>
            <h3>The Looks</h3>
            <p>
                A fluffy animal is a soft companion whos eyes could buckle the knees of a
                giant at a simple glance, and whos fur can make a years worth of stress go
                away with a simple hug. No matter how you interact with them, whether it
                be through the screen of your device or a glance accross the park, a fluffy
                animal will make your face scrunch up and make you greatful for every event
                that happened in your life lead to that scene of events where you saw that
                fluffball.
            </p>
            <h3>The benefits</h3>
            <p>
                have you ever had problems initiating conversation with the sex of preference,
                well my friend that wish is going to become a reality after adopting yourself
                a fluffy animal, whats even beter is that you dont even have to initiate, the
                magnetic pull of your pets pure and precious face will drop the jaws of everyone
                who sees them, very soon youll be hearing "nawww so cute" and "can I pet them,
                oh sorry I forgot to ask your name" (timeless classic). The fluffy animal has
                a passive ability called "appreciation" which causes you to feel gratitude
                towards everything that you didnt think you could even feel grateful for,
                an example being the peson who cut ahead in line at the icecream stand,
                but actually because of that you get to see a cute pomeranian trot past and
                BOOM! you are now appreciative that the paerson who cut in line did so.
            </p>
